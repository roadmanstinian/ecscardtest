HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
INTRODUCTION
The information in this guide is for ECS Health,
Safety and Environmental Awareness Assessments
taken from 6 May 2024.
The electrotechnical industry is constantly striving to improve
the Health and Safety awareness of everyone working in the
industry. The Electrotechnical Certification Scheme (ECS)
Health, Safety and Environmental Awareness Assessment
was originally introduced in 2002 in compliance of the
Electrotechnical Certification Scheme’s affiliation to the
Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) that requires
anyone obtaining or renewing an ECS Card to demonstrate
an acceptable standard of health and safety knowledge.
THE ASSESSMENT
The ECS Health. Safety and Environmental Awareness
Assessment is made up of 50 multiple choice questions
drawn randomly from the question bank to be completed
in 30 minutes. Each question will require one correct
answer to be picked from a choice of four.
The assessment will be made up from questions covering
eleven topics. The numbers of questions that will be used
from each topic are:
General Health and Safety at Work 6
Manual Handling Operations 4
Reporting Accidents 3
Personal Protective Equipment at Work 4
Health and Hygiene 3
Fire and Emergency 9
Work at Height 5
Work Equipment 4
Special Site Hazards 3
Electrotechnical 6
Environmental
To successfully pass an assessment, 43 out of the 50
questions must be answered correctly.
If the delegate is unsuccessful they may take a new
assessment. A fee is chargeable by the assessment
organisation for each assessment taken by the delegate.
PREPARATION
This guide should be used to help prepare for the
assessment. The guide contains all the questions that
can be used to make up the awareness assessment,
together with the correct answer and, where applicable,
a brief explanation of the answer. The assessment uses a
selection of the questions from the question bank printed
in this guide, however, the four answers in the assessment
may be in a different order from the order shown in this
guide. There are no questions in the assessment that are
not in this guide. The assessment is designed to test basic
knowledge and awareness of health and safety for people
working in the electrical industry and on construction sites.
The awareness assessment is not trying to trip up or catch
people out. all the questions in the assessment are listed
in this guide. The ECS Health Safety and Environmental
Awareness Assessment may be used as the end of course
test for health and safety training but in no way should
be considered a qualification in Health and Safety.
ENGLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND
The ECS HSE Awareness Assessment is available online
through the MyECS and Employer Portal and this remote
invigilation system is the quickest and simplest way to do
the assessment.
For those who wish to attend a physical centre
for assessments, please see the ECS website at
www.ecscard.org.uk/venues
SCOTLAND

HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
IN CENTRE ASSESSMENTS
The delegate will need:
• Photographic identification such as an ECS card, current
passport or in date photo driving license
• National Insurance Number
• A valid personal email address (for the result to
be sent to if taking the computer-based version
of the assessment).
An invigilator will explain how to take the assessment,
will check the delegate’ s identity and take the delegate’s
photograph as a record of the person who took the
assessment.
For delegates that are not confident in using computer
equipment, a practice test is available before the main
assessment is taken. To take the practice assessment the
delegate must request it from the session invigilator prior
to taking the main assessment. There is no charge for the
practice assessment.
The invigilator will be on hand during the assessment
to provide administrative support but will not offer any
assistance with answering the assessment questions.
If a computer-based assessment is taken the delegate will
be informed of their result at the end of the assessment.
The delegate will also be able to review the answers to
the questions that were in their assessment.
